# BDAH 2014 Workshop Proposal

## Summary:
Increasingly, healthcare professionals are faced with larger and larger
datasets, hence the need for conferences such as this one. The pressure is on
them to understand the complex relationships among the variables and to then
provide actionable recommendations. 

This workshop is intended to be a practical introduction to healthcare analytics
in `R`. The intention is for it to be quite self-contained. Hence it will start
with an overview of the technical background requried for the workshop. Then it
will cover an essential tool for exploring the data: visualisation. Through
visualisations, one can gain a good intuition of the relationships within a
dataset. (Viewed from different angles...) This section will consist of three
types of visualisation techniques that can be used to explore a data-set, and
that are readily available in `R`. The three tracks can be categorised as
conditional plotting using the grammar of graphics, interactive charts, and
animations. `R` packages that provide these capabilities will be introduced. 

By focusing all three sections on one dataset, the attendee will be able to see
the overall workflow of an analyst, and understand which tools to apply at which
stage.

## Speakers/Instructors:
1. Dan Wu, Team Lead, Healthcare Analytics Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.
2. Julian Lee, Founder, Singapore R User Group, Ex-researcher, National Cancer
Centre.
3. Vik Gopal, Lecturer, Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, NUS.

## Topics:
1. Overview of Descriptive Statistics and Inference.
2. Data Visualisation with `R`.
* Overview of Grammar of Graphics
* Lattice plots with `ggplot2` or `lattice` library.
* Dashboarding and interactive plots with `shiny`.
* Animating plots with `animate`.
3. Workflow-based Data Mining with `R`.   

## Target Audience:
The target audience are healthcare analytics professionals, looking for ways to
increase their efficiency in understanding and visualising their data.

## Level of material covered. (could be combined with Topics)
Topic 2 will start with basic commands and build on them to an intermediate
level. A rough gauge would be that 50 - 60 % of the material is at an
intermediate level, but it would be accessible by anyone with basic familiarity
with `R`, or by anyone who carries out statistical analysis with a statistical
language of some sort.

## Speaker Bios:
Vik Gopal obtained his PhD from the University of Florida, with a dissertation
on running Markov chains in parallel. Upon graduation, he joined the IBM
Research Collaboratory in Singapore and worked with government agencies on
traffic prediction and weather modeling problems. He is currently working at NUS
as a lecturer in the department of statistics. He is an ardent fan of `R` due to
it's vast library of user-contributed statistical routines and excellent
visualisation capailities.
