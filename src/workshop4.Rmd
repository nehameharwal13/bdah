# ABOUT THE WORKSHOP


## BDAH 2014 {.smaller}

![International Conference on Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare 2014](img/bdah2014.png "International Conference on Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare 2014")

<br>
The **International Conference on Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare 2014** ([BDAH 2014](http://chi.nus.edu.sg/conference2014/)) provides a platform for healthcare decision makers, researchers, administrators, care-providers and industry leaders and representatives to gain insights into the strategies and analytic tools and techniques for dealing with big data in healthcare. It also provides the opportunity for participants to network with experts and share experience to deal with the oncoming data analytic challenges posed by big data.

This workshop is the BDAH 2014 [Pre-Conference Workshop](http://chi.nus.edu.sg/conference2014/programme.html#workshops) #4.


## Synopsis {.smaller}

*  Today's healthcare analytics professionals are under pressure to first
   understand large and complex datasets, and to then recommend actions in a timely
   fashion.
*  In this workshop, we aim to use a single case-study and demonstrate how R can
   be used to help in the above situation.
*  The workshop is self-contained and assumes no prior R knowledge.
*  The workshop will aim to cover:
    * R fundamentals,
    * Exploratory data analysis via visualisations, and 
    * Basic statisical inference and modeling.
*  By using a single case-study, we seek to demonstrate the overall work flow of
   an analyst, with specific regard to R as his/her tool.
*  All codes, slides and data will be available on
  [github](https://github.com/singator/bdah) for attendees to refer to, modify
  and freely use.

- Inferential data analysis

    - Hypothesis testing involving one or more samples
    - Analysis of variance
    - Inference on proportions and contingency tables
    - Linear regression and logistic regression

## Educational Objectives

- The primary objective of this workshop is to get R users (including those who are new to R) to a level where they can comfortably carry out the following tasks:
    
    - Exploratory data analysis via visualizations
    
    - Basic inference and modeling

- To assist in achieving the primary objective, the presenters will share all our R code on GitHub before the workshop itself. We trust that this approach will help overcome the initial barriers to using or switching to R. By studying and modifying our code, the attendees will be able to carry out similar analyses on their own datasets almost immediately.

## Case Study: Framingham Heart Study {.build}

![The Framingham Heart Study](img/fhs.png "The Framingham Heart Study")

<br>

- On 29 September 2013, the [Framingham Heart Study (FHS)](http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org) celebrated 65 years since the examination of the first volunteer in 1948. During this period, the landmark study has provided substantial insight into the epidemiology and risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The origins of the study are closely linked to the cardiovascular health of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his premature death from hypertensive heart disease and stroke in 1945.

- [A *Lancent* article](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)61752-3/abstract) by Dr. Mahmood and team gave an excellent historical overview of selected contributions from the FHS.

- We uses the FHS as *the* case study for this workshop.
