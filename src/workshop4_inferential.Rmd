# INFERENTIAL STATISTICS


## Expectation Management {.flexbox .vcenter}

This is **not** a graduate-level math / stats class.

## Expectation Management {.flexbox .vcenter}

A journey of a thousand miles begins with the **first** step. There are some very basic inferential stats to get you started **comfortably** with R.

## Expectation Management {.flexbox .vcenter .build}

I am a [casual user](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Casual+User) of R. If I can do it, you **can** do it too!

So, ask Vik (hello, Stats PhD) about anything you don't understand today ;)

## Load R Packages and FHS Dataset {.smaller .build}

The following R packages are useful **in and beyond** this workshop.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(psych)
```

R works with CSV and [many other](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.html) data formats. 

```{r}
fhs <- read.csv("frmgham2.csv")
```

The following converts column names to upper case for ease of reference to the [FHS data documentation](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/static/studies/teaching/framdoc.pdf). However, such a conversion is generally neither necessary nor recommended. Instead, cultivate **good R habits** by learning from [Google's R Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml). 

```{r}
colnames(fhs) <- toupper(colnames(fhs))
```


## Task 1: Hypothsis Testing for a Single Sample {.flexbox .vcenter}

![Heart beat](img/heartbeat.jpg "Heart beat. Image source: http://goo.gl/OWg2o7")
<br>

We wish to know whether the mean heart rate of "healthy" people at exam 1 is equal to 70 beats per minute (bpm). The criteria for "healthy" will be discussed soon.


## Task 1: Hypothsis Testing for a Single Sample | --- But first, understand your data (with summary stats) {.smaller .build}

```{r}
with(fhs, summary(HEARTRTE)) # summary(fhs$HEARTRTE) 
```

To get other summary stats, use `length(HEARTRTE)`, `sd(HEARTRTE)`, `range(HEARTRTE)`, etc. Or try the following "shortcut".

```{r}
with(fhs, describe(HEARTRTE))
```


## Task 1: Hypothsis Testing for a Single Sample | --- But first, understand your data (with graphs) {.smaller .build}

```{r}
ggplot(fhs, aes(HEARTRTE)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "white")
```


## Task 1: Hypothsis Testing for a Single Sample | --- But first, understand your data (with graphs) {.smaller .build}

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(fhs, aes(x = HEARTRTE, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2)
```


## Task 1: Hypothsis Testing for a Single Sample | --- Let's take a "healthy" group at exam 1 {.smaller .build}

```{r results = "hide"}
fhs.healthy <- filter(fhs, PERIOD == 1 & CURSMOKE == 0 & BMI < 25 & DIABP < 80 
                      & SYSBP < 120 & DIABETES == 0)

with(fhs.healthy, describe(HEARTRTE))
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(fhs.healthy, aes(x = HEARTRTE, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density(fill = "green", alpha = 0.2)
```


## Task 1: Hypothsis Testing for a Single Sample | --- [One-sample *t*-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#One-sample_t-test) {.smaller .build}

We wish to know whether the mean heart rate of "healthy" people at exam 1 is equal to 70 bpm. [Null hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis), $H_0: \mu = 70$. [Alternative hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis), $H_1: \mu \neq 70$. We test the null hypothesis with a **one-sample *t*-test** at a [significance level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance) ($\alpha$) of 0.05.

```{r}
with(fhs.healthy, t.test(HEARTRTE, mu = 70))
```

**Interpretation**: Since $p > 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the mean heart rate of "healthy" people at exam 1 is statistically significantly different from 70 bpm. 


## About Null Hypothsis ;) {.smaller .flexbox .vcenter}

"Hell, my eighth grade science class managed to conclusively reject it just based on a classroom experiment. It's pretty sad to hear about million-dollar research teams who can't even manage that."

## Task 2: Hypothsis Testing (HT) for 2 Samples {.flexbox .vcenter}

![Two hearts](img/2hearts.png "Two hearts. Image source: http://goo.gl/Y1kngK")
<br>

Task 2a: We wish to know whether there is a difference in mean heart rates between exam 1 and exam 2. 

Task 2b: We wish to know whether there is a difference in mean heart rates between men and women at exam 1.


## Task 2a: HT for 2 Samples, Paired Comparisons | --- But first, reshape and understand your data {.smaller .build}

Reshape heart rate data from **long** format to **wide** format.

```{r}
fhs.wide <- dcast(fhs, RANDID + SEX ~ PERIOD, value.var = "HEARTRTE")

colnames(fhs.wide)[3:5] <- c("HEARTRTE1", "HEARTRTE2", "HEARTRTE3")

tbl_df(fhs.wide)
```


## Task 2a: HT for 2 Samples, Paired Comparisons | --- But first, reshape and understand your data {.smaller .build}

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(fhs.wide, aes(x = HEARTRTE1 - HEARTRTE2, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density(fill = "red", alpha = 0.2)
```


## Task 2a: HT for 2 Samples, Paired Comparisons | --- [Paired *t*-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Dependent_t-test_for_paired_samples) {.smaller .build}

We wish to know whether there is a difference in mean heart rates between exam 1 and exam 2. $H_0: \mu_d = 0$. $H_1: \mu_d \neq 0$. We test the null hypothesis with a **paired *t*-test** at $\alpha = 0.05$.

```{r}
with(fhs.wide, t.test(HEARTRTE1, HEARTRTE2, paired = TRUE))
```

**Interpretation**: Since $p < 0.05$, we reject $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$. Therefore there is a statistically significant difference in mean heart rates between exam 1 and exam 2.


## Task 2a: HT for 2 Samples, Paired Comparisons | --- Statistical signficance vs clinical signficance {.smaller .build}

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
fhs.asample <- sample_n(fhs.wide, 200)
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(fhs.asample, aes(x = HEARTRTE1 - HEARTRTE2, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density(fill = "red", alpha = 0.2)
```


## Task 2a: HT for 2 Samples, Paired Comparisons | --- Statistical signficance vs clinical signficance {.smaller .build}

```{r}
with(fhs.asample, t.test(HEARTRTE1, HEARTRTE2, paired = TRUE))
```

Be careful when interpreting the results from hypothesis testing **if the sample size is large**, because any small departure from the hypothesized value will probably be detected, even when the difference is of little or no clinical significance.


## About *p*-value ;) {.flexbox .vcenter}

Overcome the slavish obsession for the *p*-value.

## Task 2b: HT for 2 Samples, Unpaired Compar. | --- But first, understand your data {.smaller .build}

We wish to know whether there is a difference in mean heart rates between men and women at exam 1.

```{r}
with(fhs.wide, describeBy(HEARTRTE1, group = SEX))
```


## Task 2b: HT for 2 Samples, Unpaired Compar. | --- But first, understand your data {.smaller .build}

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(fhs.wide, aes(HEARTRTE1, fill = as.factor(SEX))) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
```


## Task 2b: HT for 2 Samples: Unpaired Compar. | --- [Independent two-sample *t*-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Independent_two-sample_t-test) {.smaller .build}

We wish to know whether there is a difference in mean heart rates between men and women at exam 1. $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$. $H_1: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$. We test the null hypothesis with **independent two-sample *t*-tests** at $\alpha = 0.05$.

Assuming equal population variances, $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$, the following test generates $p < 0.05$.

```{r eval = FALSE}
t.test(HEARTRTE1 ~ SEX, data = fhs.wide, var.equal = TRUE)
```

Assuming unequal population variances, $\sigma^2_1 \neq \sigma^2_2$, the following test generates $p < 0.05$.

```{r eval = FALSE}
t.test(HEARTRTE1 ~ SEX, data = fhs.wide)
```

However, the following tests both generate $p > 0.05$. Why?

```{r eval = FALSE}
t.test(HEARTRTE1 ~ SEX, data = fhs.asample, var.equal = TRUE)
t.test(HEARTRTE1 ~ SEX, data = fhs.asample)
```


## Task 3: Hypothsis Testing for $\geq$ 3 Samples {.flexbox .vcenter}

<div class="columns-2">

![BMI chart](img/bmi.png "BMI chart. Image source: http://goo.gl/aCN3YI")

Task 3a: We wish to know whether there is a difference in mean body mass indices (BMIs) among people with different education levels at exam 1.

Task 3b: If there were a difference, we wish to know which education levels differ from one another.

</div>


## Task 3a: HT for $\geq$ 3 Samples | --- But first, understand your data {.smaller .build}

```{r}
with(filter(fhs, PERIOD == 1), describeBy(BMI, group = EDUC))
```


## Task 3a: HT for $\geq$ 3 Samples | --- But first, understand your data {.smaller .build}

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(filter(fhs, PERIOD == 1), aes(x = as.factor(EDUC), y = BMI)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "point", shape = 4)
```


## Task 3a: HT for $\geq$ 3 Samples | --- [One-way ANOVA *F*-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_analysis_of_variance#The_hypothesis_test) {.smaller .build}

We wish to know whether there is a difference in mean BMIs among people with different education levels at exam 1. $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$. $H_1:$ otherwise. We test the null hypothesis with a **one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) *F*-test** at $\alpha = 0.05$.

```{r}
summary(aov(BMI ~ as.factor(EDUC), data = filter(fhs, PERIOD == 1)))
```

**Interpretation**: Since $p < 0.05$, we reject $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$. Therefore there is a statistically significant difference in mean BMIs among people with different education levels at exam 1.

However, is the conclusion **good enough**?


## Task 3b: HT for $\geq$ 3 Samples: Post-hoc Analysis | --- [Tukey's HSD test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test) {.smaller .build}

If there were a difference (in Task 2a), we wish to know which education levels differ from one another. The **Tukey's HSD (honest significant difference) test** examines all pairwise differences in means. 

```{r}
TukeyHSD(aov(BMI ~ as.factor(EDUC), data = filter(fhs, PERIOD == 1)))
```

**Interpretation**: What can you conclude based on your learning from Task 2?
